# Intelligent-Debris-Mitigation-and-Immersive-Mission-Control

This project proposes an advanced, AI-driven system for cleaning up space debris to ensure the sustainability of space activities. It combines federated reinforcement learning-where multiple autonomous spacecraft (agents) learn together without centralizing all data-and immersive extended reality (XR) mission control interfaces for human operators.

## Key points:

Federated Reinforcement Learning: Swarms of autonomous spacecraft use advanced machine learning (like masked Proximal Policy Optimization) to collaboratively plan and execute the most efficient paths to find and remove debris, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and sharing model updates instead of raw data.

Mission Efficiency: This approach outperforms traditional planning algorithms, reducing mission time and improving adaptability for complex, multi-debris removal tasks.

Immersive XR Mission Control: Human operators interact with the swarm through advanced XR interfaces (e.g., VR/AR), improving situational awareness, decision-making, and collaboration between humans and AI agents.

Sustainability: The goal is to make debris removal scalable, efficient, and more autonomous, addressing the growing risk of space debris to future missions and orbital safety.
